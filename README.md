# Pokechat Discord Bot

*This bot uses bad code, it's highly recommended not to build off this*

I scrapped the project early after finding that there were lots of other pokemon bots, so I saw that there was no need to continnue developing it.

There is little data in it.

**Uses node.js v13 & Discord.js v12**

## Stuff to change
```
In data/settings.json:

"token" value -> "one_of_your_bots_token"
"head_developer" value -> "your_user_id"
"devmode" value -> true/false (true will make it so only you can use the bot. the way that events are handled, devmode does not apply)
```

Remember to run `npm i` before trying to run the index.js file w/ node.


### That's all
